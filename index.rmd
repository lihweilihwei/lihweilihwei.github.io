<center>_Which mode would you take?_</center>

<hr>

Determining mode choice is one of the four components in the trip-based travel demand model.

<center>![_Four-step Travel Demand Model_](four-step-travel-demand-model.png)</center>

<br></br>

The introduction of a new mode, the Dalphin, brings forth several questions:

* How well will the Dalphin be received compared to other modes?

* Which attributes influence a commuter's decision the most?

To answer these questions, we begin by gathering real responses through a <a href="statedpref.html">stated preference survey</a>, followed by <a href="MNL.html">building a model</a> that best describes the data and gain insights in the process. 

Finally, we demonstrate this model through an <a href="apps.html">interactive app</a> that allows you to tweak attributes and instantly see their effect on mode choice.

The survey had 125 respondents complete 8 choice tasks, with each choice task requiring the respondents to choose their desired travel mode given a specific situation and a particular set of attribute values. Other questions such as those related to age, income, and type of residence were asked as well.


The stated preference survey was conducted with three aims:

1. To determine how important each attribute (e.g. weather, waiting time) is in influencing the mode choice of commuters.

2. To determine how well the Dalphin might be received by the future residents of GSW.

3. To determine mode choice by carrying out Multinomial Logistic Regression (MNL).

The survey had 125 respondents complete 8 choice tasks, where each choice task required the respondents to choose their desired mode given a specific scenario and a particular set of attribute values. Other questions on like age, income, and type of residence were asked.

The stated preference survey was conducted with three aims:

1. To ascertain the importance of attributes that significantly affect the mode choice of commuters.

2. To determine how well the SAAV might be received by the future residents of GSW.

3. To determine mode choice by carrying out Multinomial Logistic Regression (MNL).
